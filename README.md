# 🧠 Custom GPTs Knowledge Base

This personal repository serves as a centralized knowledge base for documenting various platforms, APIs, and tools used in the creation of **Custom GPTs** (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) via OpenAI's platform and related ecosystems.

## 📌 Purpose

To gather, organize, and standardize technical documentation, usage notes, API endpoints, data schemas, and integration strategies from multiple platforms. This will accelerate and streamline the development of high-quality Custom GPTs tailored for specific tasks, industries, or user interactions.

## 📁 Structure

The repository is organized by platform or domain, with each folder or markdown file focusing on a single topic. Some common categories:

- `/dune-analytics/` – Query structure, TrinoSQL tips, schema references


More will be added over time as needed.

## 🔧 Use Cases

- Build Custom GPTs that can interact with or answer questions about specific platforms
- Automate documentation ingestion into OpenAI's knowledge system
- Reduce ramp-up time when building domain-specific assistants
- Enable future projects to leverage reusable, structured knowledge

## 🗂️ Format Standards

Each markdown file generally includes:

- ✅ Overview and purpose  
- 🛠️ Key concepts or endpoints  
- 📚 Reference links  
- ⚠️ Common pitfalls  
- 💡 Prompt engineering examples (if relevant)

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repository is always evolving. Expect frequent updates, restructuring, and additions as new platforms are explored or as OpenAI tooling evolves.

## 📬 Feedback / Contributions

This is a personal project, but suggestions for structure or topics are always welcome. If you'd like to propose improvements or collaborate, feel free to open an issue or fork it.
